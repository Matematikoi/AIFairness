    "## Bias scan using Multi-Dimensional Subset Scan (MDSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of bias scan is to identify a subgroup(s) that has significantly more predictive bias than would be expected from an unbiased classifier. There are $\\prod_{m=1}^{M}\\left(2^{|X_{m}|}-1\\right)$ unique subgroups from a dataset with $M$ features, with each feature having $|X_{m}|$ discretized values, where a subgroup is any $M$-dimension\n",
    "Cartesian set product, between subsets of feature-values from each feature --- excluding the empty set. Bias scan mitigates this computational hurdle by approximately identifing the most statistically biased subgroup in linear time (rather than exponential).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the statistical measure of predictive bias function, $score_{bias}(S)$ as a likelihood ratio score and a function of a given subgroup $S$. The null hypothesis is that the given prediction's odds are correct for all subgroups in $\\mathcal{D}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{0}:odds(y_{i})=\\frac{\\hat{p}_{i}}{1-\\hat{p}_{i}}\\ \\forall i\\in\\mathcal{D}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis assumes some constant multiplicative bias in the odds for some given subgroup $S$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{1}:\\ odds(y_{i})=q\\frac{\\hat{p}_{i}}{1-\\hat{p}_{i}},\\ \\text{where}\\ q>1\\ \\forall i\\in S\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ q=1\\ \\forall i\\notin S.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classification setting, each observation's likelihood is Bernoulli distributed and assumed independent. This results in the following scoring function for a subgroup $S$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "score_{bias}(S)= & \\max_{q}\\log\\prod_{i\\in S}\\frac{Bernoulli(\\frac{q\\hat{p}_{i}}{1-\\hat{p}_{i}+q\\hat{p}_{i}})}{Bernoulli(\\hat{p}_{i})}\\\\\n",
    "= & \\max_{q}\\log(q)\\sum_{i\\in S}y_{i}-\\sum_{i\\in S}\\log(1-\\hat{p}_{i}+q\\hat{p}_{i}).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Our bias scan is thus represented as: $S^{*}=FSS(\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{E},F_{score})=MDSS(\\mathcal{D},\\hat{p},score_{bias})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S^{*}$ is the detected most anomalous subgroup, $FSS$ is one of several subset scan algorithms for different problem settings, $\\mathcal{D}$ is a dataset with outcomes $Y$ and discretized features $\\mathcal{X}$, $\\mathcal{E}$ are a set of expectations or 'normal' values for $Y$, and $F_{score}$ is an expectation-based scoring statistic that measures the amount of anomalousness between subgroup observations and their expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive bias emphasizes comparable predictions for a subgroup and its observations and Bias scan provides a more general method that can detect and characterize such bias, or poor classifier fit, in the larger space of all possible subgroups, without a priori specification."
